This plugin provides a service to transform data from your model into the format
proposed by the Hypertext Application Language (HAL).

HAL is a simple way of linking with JSON or XML.

It provides a set of conventions for expressing hyperlinks to, and embeddedness of,
related resources - the rest of a HAL document is just plain old JSON or XML.

HAL is a bit like HTML for machines, in that it is designed to drive many different
types of application.
 
The difference is that HTML is intended for presenting a graphical hypertext interface
to a ‘human actor’, whereas HAL is intended for presenting a machine hypertext 
interface to ‘automated actors’.
